What is this meeting about?

https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/Python_Office_Hours

This is a chance for people of all experiences levels to get together for programming, socializing, and moral support while working on things.

This is a flipped "office hours" where you can learn from your peers.

In flipped classrooms students watch lectures and read material outside the classroom then work on things in person. This isn't a formal class, but the idea is similar. Many people who attend are there to help.

If you prefer to work on things on your own, that is okay too!

We talk on irc during office hours at #pumpingstationone on lebre.chat.
https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/IRC

It is handy for sharing links to information and pastebins.

If you don't already have something to work on or study, feel free to show up and see what is going on.

What to bring?

An interest in Python

A kind attitude and good conduct: Everyone is expected to Be excellent to each other (https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/Be_excellent_to_each_other) at the space. On top of that, I'd like to make this a setting that follows the Recurse Center User's Manual (https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment) on social rules. Their social rules make learning environments more productive and friendly. I also expect everyone to follow the Python Office Hours Code_of_Conduct (https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/Python_Office_Hours/Code_of_Conduct).

A computer: We have wifi at the space, but we don't have extra computers floating around. If you have trouble bringing a laptop, talk to us before the event. We can try to find one for you but we need to know beforehand (preferably a few days)."

Non-alcoholic beverages will be available. They also have food for purchase. No outside food please.

We'll be implementing the [Pacman Rule](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/) at this meetup:

"When standing as a group of people, always leave room for 1 person to join your group. More memorably, stand like Pac-Man!

The new person, who has been given permission to join your group, will gather up the courage, and join you! Another important point, the group should now readjust to leave another space for a new person.

Leaving room for new people when standing in a group is a physical way to show an inclusive and welcoming environment. It reduces the feeling of there being cliques, and allows people to integrate themselves into the community."
