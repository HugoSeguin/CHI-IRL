# 3. Worker: Scraping Logic (1-2 hours)

## Write the Worker
Create a new file: `src/index.js`

```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    if (url.pathname === "/scrape") {
      const response = await fetch("https://example.com/events");
      const text = await response.text();
      
      // Simple scraping example
      const eventMatches = text.matchAll(/<h2>(.*?)<\/h2>/g);
      const events = [...eventMatches].map(m => ({ title: m[1], date: "TBD" }));
      
      // Store in D1
      for (const event of events) {
        await env.EVENTS_DB.prepare(`
          INSERT INTO events (title, date, location, source_url) 
          VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
        `).bind(event.title, "TBD", "Unknown", "https://example.com/events").run();
      }

      return new Response("Scraped and stored!");
    }
    return new Response("Hello from Worker!");
  }
};
```

## Deploy Worker

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

## Migrate from Python to Cloudflare Workers

Follow the steps to transition your existing Python logic to Cloudflare Workers. This involves setting up the worker environment and migrating your code logic.

## Set Up Cloudflare D1

Ensure your worker is connected to Cloudflare D1 for database operations. Follow the instructions in the D1 Database Setup markdown.

## Implement Next.js Frontend

Create a Next.js frontend to interact with your worker and display data. Follow the instructions in the Frontend Setup markdown.

## Enable Cloudflare Analytics

Integrate Cloudflare Analytics to monitor and analyze traffic and performance.

## Testing & Debugging

Refer to the Testing & Debugging markdown for procedures to ensure everything is working correctly.
